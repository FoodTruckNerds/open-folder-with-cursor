= Cursor Open With Folder

This repository contains `.reg` files that allow you to add "Open with Cursor" context menu options to Windows Explorer. These options enable you to quickly open a selected folder or the current directory in Cursor.

== Features

*   **Open from Folder Background**: Adds an "Open with Cursor" option when you right-click on the background of a folder (i.e., not on a specific file or subfolder).
*   **Open from Folder in Tree/Details Pane**: Adds an "Open with Cursor" option when you right-click on a folder in the navigation tree or the details pane.

== Installation

To install these context menu options, follow these steps:

.   **Download the `.reg` files**:
    *   `add-command-to-folder-background.reg`
    *   `add-command-to-folder-in-tree.reg`
.   **Double-click each `.reg` file**: Windows will ask for confirmation to merge the information into the registry. Click "Yes" to proceed.
.   **Confirm**: A confirmation message will appear indicating that the keys and values have been successfully added to the registry.

== Usage

After installation, you can use the new context menu options:

*   **Open Current Directory**: Navigate to any folder in Windows Explorer. Right-click on an empty space within the folder. You will see an "Open with Cursor" option. Clicking it will open that folder in Cursor.
*   **Open Specific Folder**: Right-click on any folder icon (either in the navigation tree on the left or in the details pane on the right). You will see an "Open with Cursor" option. Clicking it will open that specific folder in Cursor.

== Uninstallation

To remove these context menu options, you would typically create `.reg` files that delete the corresponding registry entries. This repository does not currently include uninstallation files. If you need to uninstall, you can manually remove the entries from the Windows Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`) at:

*   `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\Open with Cursor`
*   `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\Open with Cursor`
