= Open Folder With Cursor

On Windows, in order to open a folder in Cursor from File Explorer, you have to set up the context menu options in the registry. This repository contains `.reg` files that automate the process of adding "Open with Cursor" context menu options to File Explorer.

== Features

*   **Open from Folder Background**: Adds an "Open with Cursor" option when you right-click on the background of a folder (i.e., not on a specific file or subfolder).
*   **Open from Folder in Tree/Details Pane**: Adds an "Open with Cursor" option when you right-click on a folder in the navigation tree or the details pane.

== Installation

.   **Download the `.reg` files**:
    *   `add-command-to-folder-background.reg`
    *   `add-command-to-folder-in-tree.reg`
.   **Double-click each `.reg` file**: Windows will ask for confirmation to merge the information into the registry. Click "Yes" to proceed.
.   **Confirm**: A confirmation message will appear indicating that the keys and values have been successfully added to the registry.

== Usage

After installation, you can use the new context menu options:

*   **Open Current Directory**: Navigate to any folder in Windows Explorer. Right-click on an empty space within the folder. You will see an "Open with Cursor" option. Clicking it will open that folder in Cursor.
*   **Open Specific Folder**: Right-click on any folder icon (either in the navigation tree on the left or in the details pane on the right). You will see an "Open with Cursor" option. Clicking it will open that specific folder in Cursor.

== Uninstallation

.   **Download the `.reg` files**:
    *   `remove-command-to-folder-background.reg`
    *   `remove-command-to-folder-in-tree.reg`
.   **Double-click each `.reg` file**: Windows will ask for confirmation to merge the information into the registry. Click "Yes" to proceed.
.   **Confirm**: A confirmation message will appear indicating that the keys and values have been successfully removed from the registry.
